eg. We could be able to write:
"""
#__ import_object  game_object/GameObject
"""
The game code, at runtime, could recognise the "#__"
and replace it with:
"""
import sys
sys.path.insert(1, os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) + '/..')
from game_object import GameObject
"""
As the GameObject is in the base objects folder.
